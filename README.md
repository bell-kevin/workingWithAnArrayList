# workingWithAnArrayList
Create a project that instantiates an ArrayList of Strings. Follow the directions below for adding and removing data from the ArrayList, then print out the results. You do not need to ask the user for any of this data, type it directly into the code of the main class.  Be sure to print out the usual header first, "Chapter 10 Array Lists by Student Name” with a blank line after.  Directions for the ArrayList:         Add your name        Add “games”        Add your favorite hobby        Set “enjoys” as the value in position 1        Add your favorite holiday        Remove the item in position 3        Add your birthday month        Set “programming” as the value in position 2        Remove the item at the end of the list (you’ll need to know the size of the list to do this)        Print the list  Take a screenshot of the code with the output below it.
